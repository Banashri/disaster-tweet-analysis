Idlib National Hospital is now closed down due to the massive damage caused by air raids, while Syrian Red Crescent teams were not spared bombing. The fierce bombing on the city caused a massive exodus of civilians, estimated at over 70% of the population. President Khoja said that the bombardment of Idlib is part of Assad’s adopted strategy since the very beginning of the revolution towards the liberated areas. “Assad’s strategy aims to wreak death and destruction in every area he loses to rebels, and to kill any chance for Syrians in the liberate areas to establish civil governance or restore public services,” Khoja said.Read More:  http://ow.ly/LiUHh  #Idlib #EnoughWithAssad",
